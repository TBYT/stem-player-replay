# Stem Player Replay
Replay Button for the stemplayer tracks on their website. Pressing it once will automatically replay a track when it ends.
This repository contains the source of my replay script for stem player website.

## Prerequisites
You will need to connect a stem player to https://stemplayer.com then proceed to https://www.stemplayer.com/connect/stem, or login with your purchase email on https://stemplayer.com.
How you come about a solution for connecting a stemplayer to the website is not up to me.
